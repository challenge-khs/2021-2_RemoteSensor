"library.jar" is the main contents for the research. It helps to share sensor values between mobile devices.   

There's an API document in the document directory, so please refer to it.   

Also, simple Toy apps using libraries are also available in these apk files, so it is recommended to install and use them if necessary.   

Thanks.
