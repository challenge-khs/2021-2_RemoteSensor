# 2021-2_RemoteSensor

"library.jar" is the main contents for the research. It helps to share sensor values between mobile devices.   

There's an API document in the document directory, so please refer to it.   

In addition, these apk files also have a simple toy app that uses the library to display the sensor values ​​of a remote device, so it is recommended to install and use if necessary.   

Thanks.
